# ARM Data Workbench

The ARM Data Workbench (ADW) is a revolutionary ecosystem for interacting with ARM data. It is intended to utilize the ARM Data Center's (ADC) full capabilities to improve users' experience in working with ARM data. A few of these capabilities include:

- Seamless access to data and computing resources
- Direct access to ARM and community-developed software packages
- Jupyter notebook ecosystem for data access, analysis and sub-setting
- Easy generation of standard and custom plots
- Integration of external data sets

It is expected that the ADW will revolutionize users' experience in working with ARM data and allow for increased community contributions by using and publishing open-source software while making it easier for ARM to maintain the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable) data principles.
